ðŸ“± Polymers â€“ Mobile-First Circular Economy App

1. Executive Summary

Plastic pollution is one of the worldâ€™s most urgent environmental challenges, with over 400M tons produced annually and <9% effectively recycled. Existing recycling systems are fragmented, opaque, and vulnerable to fraud.

Polymers solves these issues via a blockchain-powered recycling ecosystem with IoT verification, DePIN infrastructure, tokenized rewards, and smart contracts on Solana.

Key Highlights:
	â€¢	Rewards: Users earn POLY tokens for recycling and clean-up actions.
	â€¢	Gamification: Communities compete in challenges; AI Eco-Coach provides personalized tips.
	â€¢	Corporate ESG: Supply chains gain verified recycled materials and sustainability credits.
	â€¢	Global Eco-Map: NGOs and communities track clean-up locations, receive escrow-protected donations.
	â€¢	Market Opportunity: Recycling market $76B by 2030; circular economy $4.5T by 2030.

Visual Recommendation: One-page infographic showing token flow, eco-map, and gamification loop.
